# 🔗 Network Topology Parser & Visualizer

This project is a **Python-based tool** that *parses router configuration files*, discovers **network links**, and visualizes the complete **network topology**.  
It also provides **OSPF analysis** and allows simulating *link failures* to study **network resilience**.

---

## 📌 Features
✨ The project provides the following capabilities:

- 📂 **Parse router configuration files** (`R1.txt`, `R2.txt`, `R3.txt`).
- 🖥️ **Extract details**:
  - 🏷️ *Router hostname*
  - 🌐 *Interfaces, IP addresses, and subnet masks*
  - 📡 *OSPF advertised networks*
- 🔍 **Discover direct links** between routers.
- 🗺️ **Build and visualize** the network graph using *NetworkX* + *Matplotlib*.
- ⚡ **Simulate link failures** and recalculate shortest paths.

## 🛠️ Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. 📥 **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/network-parser.git
   cd network-parser


# 🌐 Cisco Network Project Guide

This repository serves as a **step-by-step guide** for building, designing, and implementing Cisco networking projects.  
It is tailored to learners from **beginner (CCNA)** level to **advanced (CCIE prep)** level, covering everything from **ideation to automation**.

---

## 1️⃣ Project Ideation & Scoping
💡 *Stuck on what to build?* Here are some project ideas tailored to your **goals and skill level**:

- 🟢 **For Beginners (CCNA Level)**  
  - Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) setup  
  - Multi-branch office connectivity using static or simple dynamic routing  
  - VLAN implementation with a *router-on-a-stick*  

- 🟡 **For Intermediate Users (CCNP Level)**  
  - Multi-area OSPF or EIGRP deployments  
  - BGP peering  
  - Redundant links with **HSRP/VRRP**  
  - Securing the network with ACLs and Zone-Based Firewalls  

- 🔴 **For Advanced Users (CCIE Prep)**  
  - Complex **BGP** scenarios with traffic engineering  
  - **MPLS VPNs**  
  - **QoS** for voice and video  
  - Network automation scripts  

---

## 2️⃣ Network Design & Architecture
🖼️ A solid **design** is the foundation of any successful network.  

- 🛠️ **Create Topologies** → Logical and physical diagrams  
- 🔢 **IP Addressing** → IPv4/IPv6 schemes with *subnetting & VLSM*  
- 📈 **Scalability & Redundancy** → Build fault tolerance with:  
  - STP  
  - EtherChannel  
  - First Hop Redundancy Protocols (FHRP)  

---

## 3️⃣ Technology & Product Selection
Choosing the right tools and platforms is critical:  

- 📡 **Protocols** → OSPF, EIGRP, or BGP  
- 💻 **Hardware** → Cisco routers/switches (physical or virtual)  
- 🖥️ **Simulators/Emulators**:  
  - Cisco Packet Tracer (basic labs)  
  - GNS3 or EVE-NG (realistic enterprise labs)  

---

## 4️⃣ Implementation & Configuration
⚙️ This is the **hands-on stage** of your project.  

- ✅ **Step-by-Step Guidance** → Configure Cisco devices (Routers, Switches, Firewalls)  
- 💻 **Code Snippets & Examples** → Cisco IOS / IOS-XE / NX-OS commands  
- 🔐 **Best Practices** → Build *secure & efficient* networks  

📌 **Example: Configuring an OSPF Interface**
```bash
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
R1(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
R1(config-if)# ip ospf 1 area 0
R1(config-if)# no shutdown
