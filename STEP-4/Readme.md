Of course. Let's build Step 4, the multithreaded simulation engine. This is the most advanced part of the project, bringing your network topology to life.

I will provide all the necessary code, including a new simulation_engine.py module and updates to main.py to integrate it. For your convenience, I will also provide the complete, up-to-date code for all the previous files so you have everything in one place.



## üìÅ 1. Updated Project Directory Structure

We'll add the simulation_engine.py file to your src directory.

## üìÑ 2. Code for Simulation Engine (src/simulation_engine.py)

This new module contains the SimulationEngine and a DeviceNode class. The engine manages the overall simulation, while each DeviceNode runs in a separate thread to simulate a network device. This is a simplified simulation focusing on control plane actions like neighbor discovery and responding to link failures.
