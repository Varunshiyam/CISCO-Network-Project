I will provide the code for a new reporter.py module and update the main.py script to incorporate this final step. As requested, I will also supply the complete code for all project files so you have the entire up-to-date application.

📁 1. Final Project Directory Structure
We will add the last file, reporter.py, to the src directory. The structure is now complete.

📄 2. Code for Report Generator (src/reporter.py)
This new module is responsible for taking all the data collected during the previous steps and compiling it into a single, structured JSON file.
